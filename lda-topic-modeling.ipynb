    "For a homework assignment on Latent Dirichlet Allocations, I decided to try topic modeling for *The Human Side of Animals* (1918) by Royal Dixon (wow, real name), author of *The Human Side of Plants* and *The Human Side of Trees*. In the spirit of Mr. Dixon, we'll take a look at the human side of machines and see if we can generate a tidy little summary of his work without reading it ourselves. We'll use a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for this.\n",
