    "# Topic modeling: *The Human Side of Animals*\n",
    "\n",
    "For a homework assignment on Latent Dirichlet Allocations, I decided to try topic modeling for *The Human Side of Animals* (1918) by Royal Dixon (wow, real name), author of *The Human Side of Plants* (1885) and *The Human Side of Trees* (1917). In the anthropomorphizing spirit of Mr. Dixon, we'll take a look at the human side of machines and see if we can generate a tidy gist of his work without reading it ourselves. Book from Project Gutenberg.\n",
